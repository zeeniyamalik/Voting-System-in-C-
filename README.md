**Voting-System-in-C**
This is a console-based voting system created as part of a hackathon with a team. The system allows users to cast votes for three candidates, displays election results, and ensures data persistence by storing voting data in a text file.

**Technologies Used:**

C Programming Language and Concepts
Structs and Arrays
File Handling

**Features:**

_Candidate Display:_ Shows candidate details (ID, name, and party name).
_Vote Casting:_ Allows users to vote by entering a candidate’s ID, with input validation. The vote is recorded in a file.
_Results Display:_ Calculates and displays the total votes for each candidate, storing the results in a file.
_Data Persistence:_ Uses file handling to save voter information, candidate details, and election results.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the program using a C compiler.
3. Use the on-screen menu to:
  - View candidates' information
  - Cast votes
  - See election results
Follow the prompts to vote by entering a candidate’s ID.

**Contributions:**

- Designed and implemented the core logic for vote casting and election result display.
- Worked collaboratively with two other developers to ensure project success and meet deadlines.
- Utilized file handling to store voter details and results, ensuring data persistence.
